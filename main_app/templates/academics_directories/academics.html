It is the responsibility of parents to provide all materials needed for projects to be done at home. Homework must reflect <strong>student effort</strong> and all assignments must be presented in a <strong>decent and timely manner</strong>. Homework will be taken into account as a part of the students' <strong>final grade</strong>.
