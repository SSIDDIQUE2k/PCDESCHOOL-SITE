<h1><strong>Emergency Information Sheets</strong></h1>

<div class="content">
    <p>
        In times of emergency, it is extremely important that the office has information that will enable us to contact parents immediately. Therefore, parents are asked to complete and return to school the Emergency Information Sheets sent home at the start of the school year.
        This sheet should be completed for every child attending school. Please notify the school of any changes in information during the school year.

<h1><strong>Health Issues</strong></h1>

        Requests for changes to a child's normal school day due to health issues will only be accommodated if accompanied by a written note from a physician. If your child is absent for more than three days, a doctor's note will be required. Please do not send your child to school if:
