        This is our school, where peace dwells. Let the rooms be filled with contentment.
        Love abides here: love of one another, love of mankind, love of life itself, and love of God. Let us remember that, just as many hands build a house, so many hearts make a school.

    <h1>Belief Statement</h1> <!-- Changed to h2 for hierarchical correctness -->
    <p>We believe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning is a lifelong journey.</li>
        <li>Children, families, and the school community share responsibility for learning and behavior.</li>
        <li>Everyone thrives in a safe environment.</li>
        <li>Each staff member provides an atmosphere where children can question and explore, which helps them develop skills to solve problems independently and collaboratively.</li>
        <li>Respect for others must be modeled, so children can experience what kindness looks like and feels like as they interact with others.</li>
        <li>All students can learn, but not all learn in the same way or at the same pace.</li>
        <li>Regular attendance, punctuality, and preparedness are essential for success in school.</li>
        <li>Change is a source of growth and development.</li>
        <li>We can accomplish more by working together than we can by working alone.</li>
    </ul>
